# Hello there! I'm Karl 👋

![Hi there, I'm Karl](./src/img/repo-header.webp)

I'm a **full-stack JavaScript developer and learning technologist** who loves building better digital learning experiences through code and collaboration.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer and learning technologist with **over 15 years** of experience bridging education and software engineering across the UK and EU. I combine my hands-on development skills with insights into pedagogy to create scalable, user-centric digital learning platforms.

Currently, I work at **Imperial College London**, where I'm driving the rollout of a unified [learning management system (LMS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/education/our-projects/learning-management-system/). I collaborate across faculties, write user stories, test APIs, and shape training strategies to ensure that technology truly serves educators and learners.

Before that, I enhanced a global EdTech LMS that supported **over 700,000 users**. I optimised GraphQL APIs, automated tests, and delivered high-availability systems that learners worldwide rely on every day.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy building apps and automation tools with JavaScript and Python. I'm always looking for ways to improve digital access and user experience.
