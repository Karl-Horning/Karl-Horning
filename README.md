# 👋 Hello, I'm Karl

I'm a **full-stack JavaScript developer** and **learning technologist** from the UK.  
I love solving real-world problems through code — especially around APIs, data, and accessible interfaces that make learning more inclusive.

---

## 🧭 What I Do

I bridge education and software engineering, building reliable, user-centred systems that make technology work for people.  

At **Imperial College London**, I'm helping roll out a unified [Learning Management System (LMS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/education/our-projects/learning-management-system/), collaborating across faculties to integrate tools, streamline workflows, and improve accessibility.  

Previously, I worked at **[Learnlight](https://www.karlhorning.dev/projects/learnlight-platform)**, where I helped optimise the GraphQL backend that powers learning for **700,000+ users in 180+ countries** — reducing query loads, improving stability, and shaping developer experience.

## 🌟 Featured Work

**🎓 [Learnlight Platform & Mobile Apps](https://www.karlhorning.dev/projects/learnlight-platform)**  
Scalable learning ecosystem used by 700k+ learners in 180+ countries.  
I optimised GraphQL performance (cutting redundant queries 36→1), implemented rate limiting, and automated backend testing.  
**Focus:** backend architecture, performance, developer experience.

**💻 [KarlHorning.dev – Building a Modern, Accessible Developer Portfolio](https://www.karlhorning.dev/projects/karlhorning-dev)**  
My [Next.js + TypeScript portfolio](https://www.karlhorning.dev) — accessible, modular, and fully automated.  
It achieves **100% accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)** and **99–100 Lighthouse scores**, with Playwright + axe-core tests and GitHub Actions CI/CD.  
**Focus:** accessibility, maintainability, and front-end architecture.

**📘 [CMALT Portfolio](https://www.karlhorning.dev/cmalt)**  
Accredited portfolio demonstrating my practice as a Learning Technologist — reflecting on professional experience, evidence, and impact across education and technology.  
**Focus:** professional development, reflection, and accessibility in digital learning.
