ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Karl, a seasoned Full-Stack Software Engineer passionate about architecting robust, scalable, and high-performance web solutions. With expertise in GraphQL, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, I've contributed to the development of resilient applications, notably achieving a 99.94% uptime for Learnlight's learner platform. I'm committed to automating processes and ensuring top-notch quality in every project.

Beyond code, I wear multiple hats. As a Freelance English Teacher, I've tailored bespoke courses for professionals and students, fostering language proficiency and confidence. My diverse skill set extends to Transformation Project Management, where I've streamlined operations with Python scripts and spearheaded seamless transitions to new technologies.

From virtual onboarding to talent acquisition, I've blended technical prowess with effective communication and project management skills. Whether it's crafting code or mentoring the next generation of tech talent, I thrive on challenges that demand creativity and collaboration.

Excited to connect and collaborate on open-source projects! You can find me [here on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-horning/) and check out some of my work on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/karlhorning). Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€
